//Stopping here today
//
//I was attempting to test if all the permissions are set right.
//Tomorrow I will have to test the rest of the objects then review
//the requirements.
//
//Questions
//
//Timer how does the timer work. 
//What is supposed to go into ISteerable.
//UML diagram help. How are the arrows supposed to go.
